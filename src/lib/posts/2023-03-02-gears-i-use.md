excerpt: As a programmer and content creator I use various gears to complete my day to day tasks. Though advance gears are not the most important things, they most certainly help. In this article I will share the gears I use everyday.

Though advance gears are not the primary needs, they certainly help. [It's been 19+](https://dlohani.com.np/blog/my-years-in-programming) years since I started learning and programming. I have used from a PC with a 256MB RAM to currently a PC with 64 GB RAM. So believe me, your commitment is more important than any advance gears.

## Desk

I used regular desk setup for many years and last year I upgraded to Sit-Stand desk with my own custom table top. My desk holds my PC, 2 monitors, speaker set and my laptop. It is complemented by a Fantech Gaming chair. I'm thinking of upgrading my chair, if you have a suggestion on chair that's available to buy in Nepal do let me know.

## PC

I've a custom built PC with [AMD Ryzen 9 5900x](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-5900x) with 12 cores. It consists of 64GB of RAM and [Nvidia 1080Ti](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/geforce-gtx-1080-ti/specifications/) graphics card. I use it for my day to day work while at my desk, video calling, screen recordings, video editing and rendering.

## Laptop

My work laptop is [MacBook Pro M1 2020](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP824) edition with 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD and runs Mac OS Ventura 13.2. My personal laptop is [Lenovo Y50-70](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/lenovo-y50-70-the-ultimate-gaming-machine/) with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD and 1TB HDD and runs Arch Linux with i3 window manager.

## Monitors

I have a dual monitor setup for my PC, where one is [BenQ PD2700Q](https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/professional/pd2700q.html, a 27 inch 2K monitor and another is [BenQ PD2700U](https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/professional/pd2700u.html, a 27 inch 4K monitor. I also use my 4k Monitor while working at home with my laptop to extend my setup.

## Mouse

I upgraded to [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.910-006556.html) last year and I couldn't be more satisfied. It's chargeable and the battery life is amazing. I charge it only twice or three times in a month.

## Keyboard

Around same time I got my new mouse, I also upgraded to [Kinesis Split Keyboard](https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/edge/) with programmable keys. It was difficult at the beginning to work with the split keyboard but now it feels so awesome.

## Headphone

Last year as a new year gift allowance Appwrite provided, I bought [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b) noise canceling headphone for myself. I was never satisfied with my headphones before. The sound quality, battery life and noise cancelation are all amazing. On top of that, it simultaneously connects to two devices automatically switching between them.

## Phone

I recently switched to [Pixel 7 Pro](https://store.google.com/ca/product/pixel_7_pro?hl=en-GB) smart phone. Before this I was used Oppo Reno 2F for almost 4 years. I plan to use my Pixel 7 Pro for next 4-5 years before upgrading to another phone.

## Cameras

I have a [Cannon 200D](https://www.canon.co.uk/cameras/eos-200d/) a beginner friendly DSLR with 18-75mm kit lens as well as an upgraded 50mm potrait lens for videos and potraits. However recently I shoot more of videos using either my Pixel 7 Pro or my Dad's Iphone 13 Pro which he got recently as well. I also have [Logitech Brio USB](https://www.logitech.com/en-ph/products/webcams/brio-4k-hdr-webcam.960-001105.html) webcam attached to my PC for video calls and PC video recording needs.

## Microphone

I was using [Rode Wireless Go](https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelessgo) for few years now with my DSLR, however after wanting to switch to my phones for videography I got myself a [DJI mic](https://www.dji.com/mic). I am impressed with both the sound quality and the battery life. It comes with two transmitters and one receiver. We can use both together or one after another. I also have a [Rode NT USB](https://rode.com/en/microphones/usb/nt-usb) mic with amazing sound quality connected to my PC for video calls and PC recordings. I have been using it for more than 4 years now and it's still amazing.

## Conclusion

However, this is not how I started my developer journey. I started my journey with a PC that had 256MB of RAM and 20GB HDD. Important thing to remember is it's not the gears, it's your enthusiasm, commitment and hard work that's more important to achieve what you want. So don't wait to have a advance gears, just start and you can upgrade along the way.
