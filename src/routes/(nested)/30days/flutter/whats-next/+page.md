# What's Next?


# Advanced Animations

In this day, you will learn about more advanced animation techniques in Flutter. These include complex animations, such as those involving multiple elements or custom shapes.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Review the basics of Flutter app development from Day 8-20.
2. Learn about more advanced animation techniques, such as custom animation curves and animating multiple elements at once.
3. Experiment with creating more complex animations, such as animating custom shapes or using physics-based animations.
4. Create a more advanced app with animations, such as a game with animated characters.

# Accessibility

Learn about the importance of accessibility in mobile app development and how to make your Flutter app accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities.

Understand the key accessibility concepts, such as assistive technologies, screen readers, high contrast mode, and font scaling.

Explore Flutter's built-in accessibility features and how to use them to make your app accessible, including adding semantic labels, focusing and highlighting widgets, and using the platform accessibility APIs.

By the end of the day, you should have a basic understanding of how to make your Flutter app accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.

# Internationalization

Internationalization is the process of making your app available in multiple languages for users around the world. Localization is the process of adapting the app to a specific language or region. In Flutter, internationalization is achieved using the Intl package.

Learn about internationalization and localization in Flutter. You can start by reading the official documentation:

- [Internationalizing Flutter apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
- [Localizing Flutter apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#localizing-for-multiple-languages)

Explore how to make your app available in multiple languages. You can use the Intl package to format dates, times, and numbers in a user's local format. You can also translate text strings into different languages using the Flutter intl_translation tool.

Implement support for multiple languages in your Flutter app. You can create separate JSON files for each language, and load the appropriate file based on the user's preferred language. You can also use the flutter_localizations package to provide translations for built-in widgets and strings.

# CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are important concepts in software development that can help streamline the app development process and improve app quality. CI/CD involves automating the build, testing, and deployment of an app, which can reduce errors and save time.

There are a number of CI/CD tools available for Flutter, including Codemagic, GitHub Actions, and Travis. Each of these tools has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you may need to experiment with different tools to find the best fit for your needs.

To get started with CI/CD for Flutter, you can refer to the following resources:
