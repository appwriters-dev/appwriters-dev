# Week 2 Wrap Up: Fluttering Through Dependencies, Networking, and Interactive UIs

Welcome back to our weekly review of the **#30DaysofMasterFlutter**. We've just wrapped up the second week, which was chock-full of exciting topics that deepened our understanding of Flutter and Dart. This week covered everything from dependency management to user input forms. Here's a breakdown of what we've been up to.

### [Dependency Management](/30days/flutter/day8)

The week kicked off with dependency management - an essential aspect of any robust Flutter app. We explored the role of Dart packages, how to use them, and the vital purpose the `pubspec.yaml` file plays in managing these dependencies. The session really underlined the importance of a well-organized `pubspec.yaml` file.

### [Networking in Dart](/30days/flutter/day9)

Day 9 was all about networking in Dart. We dived deep into how to make HTTP requests and parse JSON data - skills vital for most modern applications that rely on APIs for data. This tutorial helped us understand how Flutter apps can interact with the web.

### [Hello Flutter](/30days/flutter/day10)

With our understanding of Dart solidified, Day 10 led us to the basics of a Flutter app. We learned about the structure of Flutter apps, the role widgets play, and even created our first simple Flutter app. This was a milestone moment for many of us!

### [User Interface Design - Part 1](/30days/flutter/day11)

Next, we dipped our toes into the world of UI design in Flutter, using widgets such as Text, Container, Row, and Column. Creating a simple UI for our Flutter app was both educational and fun, bringing our apps to life.

### [User Interface Design - Part 2](/30days/flutter/day12)

We continued with UI design on Day 12, moving onto more complex aspects like building a scrollable layout and exploring scrolling widgets such as SingleChildScrollView, ListView, and GridView. These widgets are vital for creating dynamic, scrollable content in your apps.

### [Images and Fonts](/30days/flutter/day13)

On Day 13, we learned how to enrich our apps with images and fonts. Here we revisited the `pubspec.yaml` file, leveraging it to manage our assets. The ability to add unique fonts and images really allowed us to begin personalizing our Flutter applications.

### [Interactive UI](/30days/flutter/day14)

Day 14 had us back to UI work, this time focusing on interactivity. We delved into state, StatefulWidget, and how to use `setState()`. These concepts are crucial to making your Flutter apps responsive and user-friendly.

### [Forms and User Input](/30days/flutter/day15)

We ended the week by learning about forms and user input in Flutter. We got to grips with text fields and text editing controllers, implementing forms and handling user input in our Flutter apps. This knowledge paves the way for creating apps with more user interaction.

Week 2 of **#30DaysofMasterFlutter** has been enlightening, challenging, and inspiring in equal measure. As we delve deeper into Flutter, it's exciting to see our apps becoming more complex and interactive. I'm eager to see what Week 3 will bring!

Stay tuned for the next weekly review and remember: **keep on Fluttering!**
