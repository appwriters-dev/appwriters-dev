# Internationalization

Internationalization is the process of making your app available in multiple languages for users around the world. Localization is the process of adapting the app to a specific language or region. In Flutter, internationalization is achieved using the Intl package.

Learn about internationalization and localization in Flutter. You can start by reading the official documentation:

- [Internationalizing Flutter apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
- [Localizing Flutter apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#localizing-for-multiple-languages)

Explore how to make your app available in multiple languages. You can use the Intl package to format dates, times, and numbers in a user's local format. You can also translate text strings into different languages using the Flutter intl_translation tool.

Implement support for multiple languages in your Flutter app. You can create separate JSON files for each language, and load the appropriate file based on the user's preferred language. You can also use the flutter_localizations package to provide translations for built-in widgets and strings.
