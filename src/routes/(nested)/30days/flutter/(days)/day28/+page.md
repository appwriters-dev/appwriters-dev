# Testing in Flutter

Testing is an integral part of the development process. It helps you catch errors and bugs early in the development process, which saves you time and money. Flutter provides a wide range of tools and libraries that you can use to test your app. And there are also popular plugins that you can use to make your life easier.

>
> - Write unit test for the function that calculates the BMI with different data
> - Write widget test that test the UI and behavior of the app
> - Run test using `flutter test` command

By the end of this day, you will learn about the importance of testing and how to write and run tests for your app.
