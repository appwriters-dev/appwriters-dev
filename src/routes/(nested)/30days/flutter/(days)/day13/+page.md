# Day 13: Advanced Navigation

1. Review the basics of Flutter app development from Day 8-12.

2. Learn about more advanced navigation techniques in a Flutter app, such as named routes, passing data between screens, and navigating with animations.

3. Implement named routes in your app to make it easier to navigate between screens.

4. Experiment with passing data between screens using constructor arguments or the ModalRoute.

5. Implement navigation with animations using the MaterialPageRoute and Hero widgets.

Learn about more advanced navigation techniques in a Flutter app, such as named routes, passing data between screens, and navigating with animations.

Implement named routes in your app to make it easier to navigate between screens. Use the `Navigator.pushNamed` method to navigate to a specific screen.

Experiment with passing data between screens using constructor arguments or the ModalRoute. For example, you can pass data to a detail screen by providing constructor arguments when navigating to the screen. You can also use the `ModalRoute.of` method to retrieve data from the previous screen.

Add custom animations to your navigation using the `PageRouteBuilder` widget. You can use this widget to create custom page transitions and animations when navigating between screens.

By the end of this day, you should have a better understanding of how to implement advanced navigation techniques in a Flutter app, including named routes, passing data between screens, and custom animations. 

Here is an example of how to use named routes and pass data between screens:

```dart
// Define your routes
final Map<String, WidgetBuilder> routes = {
  '/': (context) => HomePage(),
  '/detail': (context) => DetailPage(),
};

// Navigate to the detail screen and pass data
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/detail', arguments: {'id': 1});

// Retrieve data from the previous screen
class DetailPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final Map args = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map;
    final int id = args['id'];
    // Use the id to fetch data from an API or database
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Detail Screen'),
      ),
      body: Text('ID: $id'),
    );
  }
}
```

This code defines two routes: the home page and the detail page. When navigating to the detail page, data is passed as arguments using the `Navigator.pushNamed` method. In the detail page, the data is retrieved using the `ModalRoute.of` method and used to display the content of the screen.
