# Hello Flutter

Flutter is a software development kit (SDK) developed by Google that allows developers to build apps for mobile, web, and desktop platforms using a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language and provides a set of pre-built UI components called widgets that can be used to build custom user interfaces for your app. Flutter is an open-source project and is free to use.

> **Project** - Famous Counter App

> - When you create a new Flutter project, it generates a counter app, that just counts the number of times you tap the button in the screent
> - Create new Fluter project and different files and folders that will be generated. Specially look into `lib/main.dart` as that's where we will spend most of our time
> - Run the app on an mobile, web, and/or desktop and see it in action

By the end of this day, you should have a basic understanding of the structure of a Flutter app and how to customize the app bar and content area with basic widgets.
