# Hello Flutter

1. Install Flutter and set up your development environment. You can follow the instructions on the Flutter website to do this (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. Create a new Flutter project using the "flutter create" command in your terminal.

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor (e.g. Android Studio, VS Code).

4. Learn about the basic structure of a Flutter app. A typical Flutter app includes a MaterialApp widget as the top-level widget, which provides common design elements such as a navigation drawer and bottom navigation bar. The Scaffold widget is also commonly used to provide a basic layout with an app bar and content area.

5. Customize the app bar and content area with widgets such as Text and Icon.

6. Run the app on an emulator or physical device to see the changes.
