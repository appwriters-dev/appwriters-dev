# Flutter Packages to Enhance Functionalities

Flutter packages are pre-built code libraries that can be added to a Flutter app to enhance its functionality. They are created by developers and made available for others to use, so that they don't have to reinvent the wheel and can save time and effort in their development work.

Packages can be used to add new features and capabilities to a Flutter app, such as displaying maps, making HTTP requests, handling state management, and more. They can also help developers avoid common mistakes and ensure that their app is using best practices.
