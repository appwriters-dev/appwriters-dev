# Asynchronous programming

1. Understand the basics of asynchronous programming in Dart
2. Learn how to use `async` and `await` to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous
3. Explore Dart's `Future` API and learn how to create, chain, and await `Future` objects
4. Handle errors and timeouts when working with `Future` objects
5. Write code that executes long-running operations in the background and returns a value to the main thread when it's done
6. Prepare for more advanced asynchronous programming topics, such as streams and isolates, in future days of the challenge
