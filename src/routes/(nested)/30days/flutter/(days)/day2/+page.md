<title>Day 2: First Dart app</title>
</svelte:head>

# First Dart app

1. Open your preferred code editor or IDE.
2. Create a new Dart console application. You can do this by creating a new project in your editor or by using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dart create my_project
```

This will create a new Dart project with the default project structure.

3. Open the main.dart file in your project and learn the syntax of Dart. You can use the Dart documentation to learn more about the language (https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour).

4. Write a simple "Hello, World!" program. In the main function, add the following code:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

5. Run the program using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dart main.dart
```

This will print the message "Hello, World!" to your console.

6. Experiment with the code and try printing different messages to the console using the "print" function. You can also try different syntax and features of the Dart language to get familiar with it.

By the end of this day, you should have a basic understanding of the Dart syntax and how to write a simple console application using it.
