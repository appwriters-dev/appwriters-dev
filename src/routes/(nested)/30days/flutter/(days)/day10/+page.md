# User Interface Design

In Flutter, UI design involves creating visual and interactive elements for your app using widgets. Widgets are pre-built components that can be arranged in a hierarchy to create complex layouts. Tools and libraries such as Material Design and Cupertino can help you design and build beautiful looking UIs.

By the end of this day, you should have a basic understanding of how to use widgets to create custom layouts and designs.

## Tips

- To understand Flutter's building blocks, which are widgets, it's important to review the basics of Dart, particularly its OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts. Widgets are essentially classes, so having a good grasp of OOP in Dart is crucial. You can improve your understanding by practicing and building more projects.
- Experiment with different widgets, such as the **Text**, **Container**, **Row**, and **Column** widgets, to create layouts and designs.
- Containers are used to wrap other widgets and provide a way to add padding, margins, and other styling. Rows and columns are used to arrange other widgets in a horizontal or vertical direction.
- A simple app with a custom layout using basic widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My App'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Image.network(FlutterLogo()),
              SizedBox(height: 16.0),
              Text(
                'Welcome to my app!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24.0),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16.0),
              Row(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
                children: <Widget>[
                  RaisedButton(
                    child: Text('Button 1'),
                    onPressed: () {},
                  ),
                  RaisedButton(
                    child: Text('Button 2'),
                    onPressed: () {},
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This creates a simple app with an app bar, a container with an image, text, and two buttons in a row.
