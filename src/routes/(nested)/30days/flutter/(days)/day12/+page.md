# User Interface Design - Part 2

Flutter provides tons of widgets that you can use to create beautiful UIs. Previous day, you learned to build simple UI with Container, Text, Rows and Columns. Today you will learn to build scrolling UIs with ListView and GridView.

> **Project** - Quotes List
>
> Given the list of [quotes in JSON](https://dummyjson.com/quotes), build a UI using  **ListView** to display the quotes. You can take inspiration for existing quotes applications in the Play Store or App Store.

By the end of this day, you should have a basic understanding of how to use widgets like **SingleChildScrollView**, **ListView**, and **GridView** to create custom layouts that scroll to reveal more content.

## Tips

- **SingleChildScrollView** with **Column** can be used to create a vertical scrolling UI.
- **ListView** can be used instead of **SingleChildScrollView** to create a vertical scrolling UI without needing to use **Column**.
- Practice building more UIs with Flutter. You can find inspiration from existing apps in the Play Store or App Store. You can also check out the [Flutter UI challenges GitHub repository](https://github.com/lohanidamodar/flutter_ui_challenges) for more ideas.
