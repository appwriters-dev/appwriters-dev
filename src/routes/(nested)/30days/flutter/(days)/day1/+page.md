# Setting up the Environment

-   Install the latest stable version of Dart and Flutter SDK.
    -   For macOS or Linux, you can download the Flutter SDK from the official website ([https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)). Extract the compressed files and add the flutter tool to your path.
    -   For Windows, you can download the Flutter SDK from the official website and run the installer. Add the flutter tool to your path.
-   Configure your IDE or code editor to work with Flutter and Dart.
    -   If you're using Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA, install the Flutter and Dart plugins from the marketplace.
    -   If you're using Visual Studio Code, install the Flutter and Dart extensions from the marketplace.
    -   If you're using another IDE or code editor, check the official Flutter documentation for instructions on how to set it up.
Once you have installed and configured everything, create a new Flutter project using the following command:

`flutter create my_project`

This will create a new Flutter project with the default project structure. You can then run the app using the following command:

`cd my_project flutter run`

This will launch the app in a simulator or on a connected device. You're now ready to start building your first Flutter app!
