# Implementing State Management

Review the basics of Flutter app development from Day 8-13.

Choose a state management approach to implement in your app, such as setState, BLoC, or Provider.

Implement the state management approach in your app to manage the state of the widgets and update the user interface accordingly.

Experiment with different scenarios where the state needs to be managed, such as user input, network requests, and animations.

By the end of this day, you should have a better understanding of how to implement state management in Flutter and how to choose the right approach for your app.

**Project**: To practice state management techniques, create a simple app that displays a counter on the home screen. The user can increment or decrement the counter by pressing buttons, and the value of the counter should be displayed on the screen. Implement state management using setState, BLoC, or Provider to manage the state of the counter.
