# Day 18: Introduction to Persistence

Review the basics of Flutter app development from Day 8-17.

Learn about persistence in Flutter and why it is important. Persistence refers to the ability to store data locally on a device so that it can be accessed later, even when the app is closed or the device is restarted.

Learn about the shared_preferences package, which provides a simple way to store key-value pairs of data locally in a Flutter app.

Create a simple app that stores user preferences, such as a theme preference, using shared_preferences.

By the end of this day, you should have a basic understanding of how to use shared_preferences to store and retrieve data locally in a Flutter app.
