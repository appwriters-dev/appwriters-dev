We will begin our journey by signing up to Appwrite cloud and creating our first project. Appwrite is an open-source backend server that helps you build apps faster. It takes care of all the backend needs of your app, so you can focus on building your app's frontend.

## Sign up to Appwrite cloud

Head over to [cloud.appwrite.io](https://cloud.appwrite.io) and click on the **Sign up** link. You will be redirected to the sign-up page. Enter your name, email address, and password and click on the **Sign Up** button.

## Create new organization

Once you have signed up, you will be redirected to the onboarding where you will be asked to create a new organization. Enter the name for your organization and select a plan. You can optionally provide a custom ID. Finally click on the **Get started** button to create your organization.

## Create new project

Once you have created your organization, you will be redirected to the projects page. Click on the **Create project** button to create a new project. Enter the name for your project. Give a custom easy to remember ID for your project. Finally, click on the **Next** button. You can then select the region for your project. However as of now there is only one region available, so just click on the **Create** button.

That's all you need to do to create your first project. You will be redirected to the project dashboard. You can now start using Appwrite for your app's backend needs.
